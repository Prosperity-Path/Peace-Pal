        "Feeling envy dishonors the beauty that comes with your uniqueness. Today, focus on your favorite couple attributes that make you unique. There's plenty of beauty there!",

        "It's most common to feel envy when you don't see the path to improving the attribute you desire, or improving it at a satisfactory rate. But humans are malleable, so there's always a way to improve, even if it's improving your perception instead of the objective measure of the attribute. Improving your perception is the fastest way to feel progress. Today, focus on the absolute smallest increment of improvement that you'd be happy with and a clear plan to make it happen. Picture yourself executing the plan and improving, and you'll be there in no time!",

        "Humans are wired to experience anxiety as a survival mechanism. We're always trying to plan for the worst case scenario as a means to ensuring we have our needs met for survival. But in a world where it's so easy to meet our needs for survival, we forget about our needs and replace them with wants. As a consquence, we stress about not gettings our wants met. So today, write what you actually NEED so you can start to strip power from the self-induced stress of imagining not getting what you want.",

        " There are no cases where worrying about something that hasn't happened yet is more productive than taking action towards your desired outcome. Today, pick one thing you're anxious about, and instead worrying, focus on the smallest action that moves you towards the desired outcome. "
