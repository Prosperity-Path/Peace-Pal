        "How much time do you spend looking out versus looking in? In other words, how much time do you spend processing your thoughts and feelings versus making new ones? For a moment, imagine every experience that you consume is a piece of raw material going into your brain. If you allocate time to process the raw material it gets converted to clean fuel and helps your stability (peace), but, if you don’t give each experience enough time to process, it doesn’t burn cleanly and creates instability. If you’re taking in way more than you’re processing, then your experiences probably create less peace instead of more. So today- write down what you think your experience-to-processing ratio is and ponder on whether or not it’s serving you well.",
        
        "If you truly believe you have control of outcomes. You will never be at peace. Attempting to control an outcome always starts with creating an expectation for a an outcome. But inevitably, reality will clash with the picture-perfect outcome you expected for your effort. Then you deal with disappointment. And the worse the disappointment, the harder it is to stabilize to a peaceful state. So today- write down the first two meaningful expectations you have for the future. Those can be opportunities for disappointment OR gratitude. Certainly- the gratitude leads to peace.",
        
        "Imagine a beautiful slab of marble that makes up an entire wall. Upon closer inspection, there’s a few cracks that run the length of the slab. Naturally, our eyes our drawn to the cracks and we think something to the effect of-- if only those cracks weren’t there. Whyyy? Unfortunately, focusing on imperfections is apart of the modern human’s wiring. And we treat ourselves like that, too. Instead of appreciating the impossibly unique and beautiful piece of marble that we are, we focus on our own cracks. And that’s a big part of what’s disrupting our peace. Instead, try writing down attributes that you love about yourself to replace the common thoughts about cracks.",
        
        "Do you know how often you want something just because someone wants it? Well, it turns out that, when you want something that someone else wants, what you actually want is that person’s love. You see that they value thing X and you want to be valued by them, so you strive for thing X because you instinctively think that means they’ll value you. There’s two traps here. First, you’ll be dissatisfied when you get thing X because you wanted it for the wrong reasons. And second- spending time with people who don’t value you unconditionally will erode your peace. So today, try identifying one thing you want because someone else wants it, then evaluate if you would want that thing if nobody knew you had it. ",
        
        "Feeling envy dishonors the beauty that comes with your uniqueness. Today, write down your three favorite attributes that make you unique. There's plenty of beauty there!",

        "It's most common to feel envy when you don't see the path to improving the attribute you desire, or improving it at a satisfactory rate. But humans are malleable, so there's always a way to improve, even if it's improving your perception instead of the objective measure of the attribute. Improving your perception is the fastest way to feel progress. Today, write down the the attribute you think you're deficient in along with the absolute smallest increment of improvement that you'd be happy with and a clear plan to make it happen. Picture yourself executing the plan and improving, and you'll be there in no time!",

        "Humans are wired to experience anxiety as a survival mechanism. We're always trying to plan for the worst case scenario as a means to ensuring we have our needs met for survival. But in a world where it's so easy to meet our needs for survival, we forget about our needs and replace them with wants. As a consquence, we stress about not gettings our wants met. So today, write what you actually NEED so you can start to strip power from the self-induced stress of imagining not getting what you want.",

        " There are no cases where worrying about something that hasn't happened yet is more productive than taking action towards your desired outcome. Today, pick one thing you're anxious about, and instead worrying, write down the smallest action that moves you towards the desired outcome. ",
    "Judging others always shows us where we have insecurities that our subconscious is demanding we pay attention to in hopes of finding resolution. Today, think about what you look at when you first meet someone. Do you look at their clothes or maybe their weight? Whatever you look at, those are likely to be the things you're most insecure about. Write down the thing you judge others on most and one way you can make progress on your own security around that attribute."
